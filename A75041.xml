            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Abſtract OF Sir <hi>CHARLES HOLT</hi>'s CASE.</head>
            <p>A Mortgage of 700 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> is made by Sir <hi>Robert Holt</hi> to Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> and alſo a Recognizance of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> is aſſign'd to him for ſecuring 5000 <hi>l.</hi> lent in Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi>'s Name, in Truſt for Mr. <hi>John Coke,</hi> ſince deceaſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> who pretended a Gift of this Money, from Mr. <hi>John Coke,</hi> after ten Years Suit with Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s Executors, and ſeveral Hearings, is decreed to transfer the Securities to Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and theſe Executors have been ſince adjudg'd to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in Truſt for <hi>Edward Coke</hi> Eſq; an Infant, who in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term 1693, obtain'd another Decree againſt Sir <hi>Charles Holt</hi> for this Money, and all Intereſt ſince the Loan of it, and for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment to hold the Mortgag'd Eſtate diſcharg'd of all Equity of Redemption. About 2800 <hi>l.</hi> has been paid for Intereſt, and receiv'd out of the Profits of the Mortgag'd Eſtate: 3000 <hi>l.</hi> more paid into the Court of Exchequer, and 2000 <hi>l.</hi> more paid lately to Mr. <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s Guardian in Obedience to the laſt Decree.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> who has the Eſtate in Law, and the Securities in his Hands, and is the only Perſon capable to reconvey the Eſtate, refuſes to reconvey it, or to deliver up the Securities, and hath ſtood out all Proceſs of Contempt for eleven Years.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Charles Holt</hi> always has been, and ſtill is deſirous, and ready to pay what remains due, if he may have his Eſtate, and is not capable of raiſing the Money otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>It is contrary to all Juſtice and Equity, that Sir <hi>Charles Holt,</hi> who has been forc'd to pay the greateſt part of the Debt, and is ready to pay the Reſidue, ſhould loſe an Eſtate of 700 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and have the reſt of his Eſtate ſubject to a Recognizance.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe has paſs'd the ordinary Judicature of the Nation, and that cannot diveſt the Eſtate out of Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> nor reſtore it to Sir <hi>Charles Holt:</hi> and unleſs there be ſome Remedy by Act of Parliament, Sir <hi>Charles Holt</hi> muſt loſe his Eſtate, tho he would pay his Debt; which Caſe it is humbly hop'd may deſerve (if any Caſe can) the Relief of an Act.</p>
